  Execution context allows the JavaScript engine to manage the complexity of interpreting and running our code.and Execution context is an abstract concept that holds information about the environment where the current code is being executed.

  2.Function execution context-->  This execution context is created whenever a function is executed.

 <pre>First Class Function-->A first class function is a function that was built with the intention of being passed around to other functions. It does one specific thing, does not have side effects, and is not intended to be called directly, but rather, to be used by other functions.
  Higher order function-->A Higher Order function is a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output.
